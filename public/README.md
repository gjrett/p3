## 3 Unique inputs
*You don't have to list all inputs, just 3 unique ones. The following is an example of what I'd put if my project was the xkcd Password Generator: (1) Text input to indicate number of words in password, (2) Checkbox to indicate whether to include a number (3) Dropdown to indicate what symbol to include*

1. *Dropdown to choose a month*
2. *Text inputs to indicate day number and year*
3. *Checkbox to indicate whether to see your fortune (may use for horoscope later)*


## Packages
*List the name of any packages you add to your project that do not come with Laravel by default; this should include, but is not limited to, barryvdh/laravel-debugbar*

barryvdh/laravel-debugbar

## Code style divergences
*list any divergences from PSR-1/PSR-2 and course guidelines on code style*

## Notes for instructor
*Any notes for me to refer to while grading; if none, omit this section*
I did have trouble trying to instal two different horoscope packages and thought I cleared
the problems when I pulled the last version down from github.  After making many changes I tried
to push the project back to github, but my comments didn't show up, so it appears it didn't save.
I ended up changing the folder name and set up a new repository, then copied the changed files to
the new project folder and pushed it back to github. Seems to ahve worked.
